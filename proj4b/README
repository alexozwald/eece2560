NOTE:  our recursion solver didnt work.  but, we mightve gotten extra credit bc 
i rewrote `board.print()` to a much more readable `operator<<` which might be 
why we still got a good score, idrk tho.  the other groups were in competition 
to see who could do it in the least amt of recursions lol.  feel free to push an 
update if you fix it lmao

to properly complete the project tho, there's an mcoding youtube tutorial on how 
to properly do it but we didnt look that up in time to get it done.  plus it 
seemed like the project was updated recently so other online references weren't 
helpful... rip.
