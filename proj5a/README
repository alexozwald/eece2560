# proj5a - maze

This one was due during finals week.  We weren't able to get it to completely
work due to time constraints & priorities but the probable issues are documented
here.  

TODO:

 - `getCoord()`: fix errors in larger node arrays (probs issues in the extra new lines we customized in `maze.txt` that didnt )
 - accomodate cases where (done in the commented out `do_dfs()` but not ready for implementation to the rest)
 - not sure if we were supposed to allow for traversing around the edges of the maze in a circular fashion
 - ~~traverse diagonal?~~
 - ...

Files included in submission:

 - p5.cpp
 - maze.h
 - maze.txt
 - graph.h
 - main.cpp
 - graph_node.h
 - graph_edge.h
 - d_matrix.h
 - d_except.h
